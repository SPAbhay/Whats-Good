Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into self-learning mode without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. So, the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use “pattern recognition” to produce reliable results.\n\nThe below topics are explained in this Machine Learning basics video:\n1. What is Machine Learning? ( 00:21 )\n2. Types of Machine Learning ( 02:43 )\n2. What is Supervised Learning? ( 02:53 )\n3. What is Unsupervised Learning? ( 03:46 )\n4. What is Reinforcement Learning? ( 04:37 )\n5. Machine Learning applications ( 06:25 )\n\nSubscribe to our channel for more Machine Learning Tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/user/Simplilearn?sub_confirmation=1\n\nDownload the Machine Learning Career Guide to explore and step into the exciting world of Machine Learning and follow the path toward your dream career- https://bit.ly/3eLuTUo\n\nWatch more videos on Machine Learning: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JhjINPwfYQ&list=PLEiEAq2VkUULYYgj13YHUWmRePqiu8Ddy\n\n#MachineLearning #WhatIsMachineLearning #MachineLearningTutorial #MachineLearningBasics #MachineLearningTutorialForBeginners #Simplilearn\n\n➡️ About Caltech Post Graduate Program In AI And Machine Learning\n\nDesigned to boost your career as an AI and ML professional, this program showcases Caltech CTME's excellence and IBM's industry prowess.

From spam filters and self-driving cars, to cutting edge medical diagnosis and real-time language translation, there has been an increasing need for our computers to learn from data and apply that knowledge to make predictions and decisions. This is the heart of machine learning which sits inside the more ambitious goal of artificial intelligence. We may be a long way from self-aware computers that think just like us, but with advancements in deep learning and artificial neural networks our computers are becoming more powerful than ever. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http://youtube.com/pbsdigitalstudios \n\nWant to know more about Carrie Anne?\nhttps://about.me/carrieannephilbin\n\nThe Latest from PBS Digital Studios: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1mtdjDVOoOqJzeaJAV15Tq0tZ1vKj7ZV\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrash...\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http://patreon.com/crashcourse\nCC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids",

Thanks for the sharp eyes that caught that!\n\nFor those who want to learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen introducing neural networks and deep learning: https://goo.gl/Zmczdy\n\nThere are two neat things about this book.  First, it's available for free, so consider joining me in making a donation Nielsen's way if you get something out of it.  And second, it's centered around walking through some code and data which you can download yourself, and which covers the same example that I introduce in this video.  Yay for active learning!\nhttps://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning\n\nI also highly recommend Chris Olah's blog: http://colah.github.io/\n\nFor more videos, Welch Labs also has some great series on machine learning: \nhttps://youtu.be/i8D90DkCLhI\nhttps://youtu.be/bxe2T-V8XRs\n\nFor those of you looking to go *even* deeper, check out the text \"Deep Learning\" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville.  \n\nAlso, the publication Distill is just utterly beautiful: https://distill.pub/\n\nLion photo by Kevin Pluck\n\nThanks to these viewers for their contributions to translations\nGerman: @fpgro\nHebrew: Omer Tuchfeld\nHungarian: Máté Kaszap\nItalian: @teobucci, Teo Bucci\n\n-----------------\nTimeline: \n0:00 - Introduction example\n1:07 - Series preview\n2:42 - What are neurons?\n3:35 - Introducing layers\n5:31 - Why layers?\n8:38 - Edge detection example\n11:34 - Counting weights and biases\n12:30 - How learning relates\n13:26 - Notation and linear algebra\n15:17 - Recap\n16:27 - Some final words\n17:03 - ReLU vs Sigmoid\n\nCorrection 14:45 - The final index on the bias vector should be \"k\"\n\n------------------\nAnimations largely made using manim, a scrappy open source python library.  https://github.com/3b1b/manim\n\nIf you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti.\nDownload the music on Bandcamp:\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\n\nStream the music on Spotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u\n\nIf you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then \"add subtitles/cc\".

As someone who's struggled their entire life with social anxiety, I find I sometimes feel like a robot, constantly programming my behavior to maximize my social output and make other people happy -- even at the expense of my own feelings. Growing up being dubbed the \"weird\" kid left me with a deep fear of exclusion; \"Machine Learning\" is my attempt to chronicle what it was like to bury that \"weirdness\" for years before I grew the confidence to show my authentic self to the world.\n\nIt truly means the world to me that I get to be so vulnerable in my music with you.

            "description": "How are technologies like ChatGPT created? And what does the future hold for AI language models?\n\nThis talk was filmed at the Royal Institution on 29th September 2023, in collaboration with The Alan Turing Institute.\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw/join\nWatch the Q&A with Mirella here: https://youtu.be/9i2x2HyeW-Y\n\nGenerative AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence that involves creating new and original data or content. Unlike traditional AI models that rely on large datasets and algorithms to classify or predict outcomes, generative AI models are designed to learn the underlying patterns and structure of the data and generate novel outputs that mimic human creativity.\n\nChatGPT is perhaps the most well-known example, but the field is far larger and more varied than text generation. Other applications of generative AI include image and video synthesis, speech generation, music composition, and virtual reality.\n\nIn this lecture, Mirella Lapata will present an overview of this exciting—sometimes controversial—and rapidly evolving field.\n\nMirella Lapata is professor of natural language processing in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. Her research focuses on getting computers to understand, reason with, and generate natural language. She is the first recipient (2009) of the British Computer Society and Information Retrieval Specialist Group (BCS/IRSG) Karen Sparck Jones award and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the ACL, and Academia Europaea.\n\n00:00 Intro\n2:38 Generative AI isn’t new – so what’s changed?\n8:43 How did we get to ChatGPT?\n12:38 How are Large Language Models created?\n22:48 How good can a LLM become?\n26:57 Unexpected effects of scaling up LLMs\n28:05 How can ChatGPT meet the needs of humans?\n32:30 Chat GPT demo\n38:07 Are Language Models always right or fair?\n40:21 The impact of LLMs on society\n42:54 Is AI going to kill us all?\n\n--\nA very special thank you to our Patreon supporters who help make these videos happen, especially: \n\nmodsiw, Anton Ragin, Edward Unthank, Robert L Winer, Andy Carpenter, William Hudson\nDon McLaughlin, efkinel lo, Martin Paull, Ben Wynne-Simmons, Ivo Danihelka, Kevin Winoto, Jonathan Killin, Stephan Giersche, William Billy Robillard, Jeffrey Schweitzer, Frances Dunne, jonas.app, Tim Karr, Alan Latteri, David Crowner, Matt Townsend, THOMAS N TAMADA, Andrew McGhee, Paul Brown, David Schick, Dave Ostler, Osian Gwyn Williams, David Lindo, Roger Baker, Rebecca Pan\n--\n\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http://twitter.com/ri_science\nand Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/royalinstitution\nand TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@ri_science\nListen to the Ri podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/ri-science-podcast\nOur editorial policy: https://www.rigb.org/editing-ri-talks-and-moderating-comments\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http://bit.ly/RiNewsletter\n\nProduct links on this page may be affiliate links which means it won't cost you any extra but we may earn a small commission if you decide to purchase through the link.",

            "description": "The Revolution Of AI - Everyone has heard about Artificial Intelligence (or AI), but very few people know what it is or how it actually works.\n\nThe Revolution Of AI (2020)\nWriters: Kyle McCabe, Christopher Webb Young\nStars: Shivani Bigler, Jason Derenick, Barbara Grosz\nGenre: Documentary\nCountry: United States\nLanguage: English\nAlso Known As: Hyper Intelligence\nRelease Date: 2020 (United States)\n\nSynopsis:\nEveryone has heard about Artificial Intelligence (or AI), but very few people know what it is or how it actually works. This episode brings this otherwise abstract topic to life by visiting the most cutting-edge engineering firms where innovative technologists are using AI to transform machines into thinking robots.\n\nLeading institutions are preparing robot rovers and flying drones to navigate through unmapped territories, in order to save lives in bold Search and Rescue missions. By ‘mapping as they go’, these thinking machines generate their own intelligence—allowing them to self-navigate without human input. Additionally, some technologists are coordinating swarms of drones to operate and collaborate together—all with the explicit ambition of improving the efficiency of farming and increasing food production.\n\nThough the news media often reports on how machines could cause unemployment, that’s not what AI inventors in this program are saying. In fact, their AI-driven robots are using machine-learning to work better with humans. Through observation, AI robots are learning to anticipate the actions of human co-workers, keeping people safer in the workplace – and making it more productive.\n\nSome scientists in this show are even developing AI robots that are achieving the beginnings of robotic consciousness. By comprehending their own self-image, they are able to learn about their environment, make decisions, and navigate the space around them – just as  human babies do. Other engineers are taking this technology even further to develop real-world Androids – that is, robots that look, feel, and act like people.\n\nBecoming consultants, advisors, and even friends, these Androids will ultimately help individuals adjust to realities of the human condition.\n\nSUPPORT US!\n✘ Membership - https://bit.ly/3q5XPBh\n\nMORE DOCS!\n► Gold: https://bit.ly/2IRZ0OA\n► World Economy: https://bit.ly/36QlhEM\n► All Playlists: https://bit.ly/3lOiCll\n\n#finance #documentaries #economy\n\nCOPYRIGHT: All of the films published by us are legally licensed.
