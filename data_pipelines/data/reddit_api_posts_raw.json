Laptops and electronics aren‚Äôt made in the US. Raw material industries like steel and aluminium took a decades long decline due to cheap Chinese alternatives becoming available. You can‚Äôt just spin up an entire resources/electronics manufacturing industry in a year or two. \n\nIt would take decades and let‚Äôs not forget the reason these industries left the US in the first place: it‚Äôs cheaper to outsource it to China. The American consumer demanded a cheaper product, the US corporations wanted to cut costs, so manufacturing was outsourced. \n\nSo it doesn‚Äôt mean that consumers switch to American-made alternatives (as they don‚Äôt exist), and end up paying more for the same products.\n\nHe didn‚Äôt bring back America‚Äôs steel industry during his last term as president, and won‚Äôt if he wins again in November. \n\nHe wants to offset this with lowering taxes, but the chances are the cost to consumer increase from tariffs will outweigh his alleged tax cuts. He‚Äôs more likely to give tax cuts to corporations and high earners than everyday Americans anyway, one again screwing over the people who vote for him.",

It targeted four Senate races and two primary races and supported former President Donald Trump‚Äôs re-election campaign. \n> \n> While it‚Äôs unclear who operated or funded the network, its focus on particular political pet projects with no clear connection to foreign countries indicates it‚Äôs an American political operation, rather than one run by a foreign government, the researchers said.\n> \n> The accounts followed a consistent pattern. \n> \n> Many had profile pictures that appealed to conservatives, like the far-right cartoon meme Pepe the frog, a cross or an American flag. They frequently replied to a person talking about a politician or a polarizing political issue on X, often to support Republican candidates or policies or denigrate Democratic candidates. While the accounts generally had few followers, their practice of replying to more popular posters made it more likely they‚Äôd be seen.\n> \n> Clemson researchers identified many accounts in the network via text in their posts that indicated that they had ‚Äúbroken,‚Äù where their text included reference to being written by AI. Initially, the bots appeared to use ChatGPT, one of the most tightly controlled LLMs. In a post tagging Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, one of the accounts wrote: ‚ÄúHey there, I‚Äôm an AI language model trained by OpenAI. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!‚Äù OpenAI declined to comment. \n> \n> In June, the network reflected that it was using Dolphin, a smaller model designed to circumvent restrictions like those on ChatGPT, which prohibits using its product to mislead others. In some tweets from the accounts, text would be included with phrases like ‚ÄúDolphin here!‚Äù and ‚ÄúDolphin, the uncensored AI tweet writer.‚Äù\n> \n> Dolphin‚Äôs founder, Eric Hartford, told NBC News that he believes the technology should reflect the values of whoever uses it.\n> \n> ‚ÄúLLMs are a tool, just like lighters and knives and cars and phones and computers and a chainsaw. We don‚Äôt expect a chainsaw to only work on trees, right?‚Äù\n> \n> ‚ÄúI‚Äôm producing a tool that can be used for good and for evil,‚Äù he said.\n> \n> Hartford said that he was unsurprised that someone had used his model for a deceptive political campaign.\n> \n> ‚ÄúI would say that is just a natural outcome of the existence of this technology, and inevitable,‚Äù he said.\n> \n> As the November elections near, the government and other watchdogs have warned of efforts to influence public opinion via AI-generated content. The presence of a seemingly coordinated domestic influence operation using AI adds yet another wrinkle to a rapidly developing and chaotic information landscape. \n> \n> The researchers only found evidence of the campaign on X. \n\nFuck off to all the people behind this - and especially those who have the power to stop and/or prevent these shenanigans from being widespread.",

Came in as an operations coordinator at $11/hr after 4 yrs working as a business analyst, directly under a VP at Citrix.  \n  \nWorked my ass off and, within 6 mo, was doing the job of an operations manager/analyst. I developed/supported the backbone of nearly every department's analytics.  My manager didn't like me b/c she saw me as a threat to her job.  Her boss's boss, the COO, knew the value I offered for practically nothing. So, being the good executive leader she was, blocked every attempt at promotions or department transfer opportunity that came my way - IT, marketing, and HR all made attempts to create jobs for me after seeing the quality/value of my work in projects I did for them.  \n  \nAfter 18 months, and threats to quit, I was up to $40k/yr.  Less than half of what the HR team's market analysis calculated my pay should be based on our location and my role, scope, and responsibilities. (I know about it because the HR director *showed it to me* after I'd started working with them extensively on their departmental analytics and had developed a very close relationship.  She then mentioned that the COO told her, \"So what?  He makes what he makes\"  after HR informed the COO I was making a fraction of my fair market value) By this point, my self confidence had started to reestablish itself and my resentment of my department, boss, and COO had festered into a roiling fire.  \n  \nThen I did a favor for the warehouse manager. I built an Excel/Access time and attendance tool since the one we'd been using didn't work well for warehouse staff.  It was super accurate, handle OT and respected the big labor laws around lunch requirements.  In vetting the accuracy I found that the company was applying CA law to stores in every state.  I saved the company $75k/year when I called it out.  In an attempt to get to my HR-established market rate, I asked for a bonus/pay increase for having saved them 2x my salary... per year.  Their reply, \"Saving the company money is part of your job.  If you ask for a raise again you'll be written up and possibly fired\"  \n  \nI'd had enough. I found another, much better job at a niche distributor in the industry and, on my way out, contacted the DOL and informed them (with receipts) of:  \n  \n* Severe wage theft by the company.  \n* Employer intimidation and retaliation against whistle blowing  \n* Wage/job discrimination against several employees and myself  \n  \nThe company was forced to pay ~$2million in back pay and $3million in fines.  \n\nMorally, nothing wrong with what I did above...  the morally questionable part is meticulously breaking all automation I'd created 3.5months before I left.  ALL of the (now business critical) reporting I'd built was hard-coded.  No formulas.  When they asked me to train someone to take over, I said no problem... trained him to do it manually, which took 20-30hrs/week vs 1-2.  \n  \nA few months later the HR director let me know my job was posted again.  At $95-110k/year.  I notified the DOL and shared all the documents of my responsibility/market adjustment requests, the HR job analysis, and an email comment from the COO that she didn't feel I was worth market rate since I have only 1-arm.  I never saw a cent but the company was, again, fined substantially and the COO was immediately fired.  \n  \nFuck you, Tracy.",

My 23 year old biology teacher/sports trainer and I had an ongoing fling that took place the entire school year. Being that it was a boarding school not only did I live on campus but she did as well. This made things unabashedly crazy. I went to her apartment daily. We would fool around all over campus including her classroom and the school library which was this insanely historical and gorgeous building. I fully believe that we never got caught because we only met up after it was dark outside. I‚Äôm guessing nobody spotted us or got suspicious because we were never seen conversing in public during the day. The times I would be at her apartment were plausible because she was my teacher and giving me extra help which was totally normal. And yes, I got all A‚Äôs in her classes. \n\nIn hindsight, fucking stupid. We both knew better and it‚Äôs crazy we didn‚Äôt get busted.\n\nEDIT to update:\n\nI never felt a negative power balance issue with her only positive. I remember us both feeling nervous for a while so I know she was scared about what we were doing as well. She had feelings for me, no question. It started because I stuck up for her in class one day after another kid called her a bitch. What can I say? I had a crush on her and one night at her apartment she made a comment that indicated I could make a move. So I did. At that point in my life it was awesome! It was a massive confidence booster, there was no drama, we both liked each other and knew it could never be anything more than what we were doing. When the school year was over I graduated and never saw or heard from her again. My life is beautiful now and I hardly ever think about that part of my story. Again, in hindsight and being a parent myself these days, it was not something to be proud of.",

She told them she was alone with a baby and to leave her alone and one guy said ‚Äúwe dont care - kid can watch‚Äù and was on the opposite side of the car at that point. Mom opened the door and our Norwegian Elkhound, who she said was quiet as could be the whole time (which is weird because they are barkers) laying on seat next to my baby seat, flew out of the car and she said she had never heard him snarl / bark /  drool at the mouth like he was and he took off after the two guys (one guy stayed across the parking lot). She said he sounded like a demon and was snapping at them as he ran at them. One guy turned and yelled ‚ÄúJesus is that a wolf‚Äù as he ran. Kai stopped after about 10 feet and came back to my \nMom who by that point had gotten in the car and locked the doors - and sat next to the car wagging and panting like he had just played ball with my dad. She sat there for a couple minutes until she could tell they were gone - hopped out - and let Kai in and took off. She was shocked by the men but just as much by our ‚Äúsweet family fur ball‚Äù as she always put it. I think he got stomach ache that night from all the treats he got when we got home. Ha. \n\nFamily never had any other kind of dog after that. Lots of  Elkhounds.

A good relationship should eventually have both partners knowing how they like to cum and what gets them there best - it's all communication whether it's verbal and direct or slower and nonverbal.\n  \nPartners do little things they don't have a passionate desire to do all the time. Housework, errands, massages, zillions of little things. The reason you do them is because it'll make your partner happy and/or you like pleasing your partner. Sex in all it's forms is no different. \n  \nThe important distinction between a healthy and unhealthy version of this is: does the receiver feel it's owed to them like an expectation or obligation, or do they appreciate it the kindness that it is. Most of the hangups around getting your partner off when you're not in the mood stem from feeling pressured to do that which is always wrong.\n  \nFor a non-sexual example look at foot rubs (assume neither partner is into feet sexually for this example lol) - the giver probably has zero passion for giving feet rubs but does it because their partner enjoys it. \n  \nThey aren't 'in the mood' for giving a foot rub nearly ever when they do it. It takes time and communication to figure out exactly how to do it best. In the grand scheme of things it doesn't take much energy or time to do it and it makes the partner physically feel better and feel loved since it's an act of pretty selfless kindness. \n  \nThe minute that footrub is an expectation, demand, or feels like a chore that's when the giver will stop wanting to do it for the receiver.\n  \nLastly, ofc sex isn't a foot massage - if you have trauma or hangups around sex any good partner should understand, but atleast do them the courtesy of communicating with them and trying to get help for the issue. \n  \nDouble lastly, for the dick owners: if you want to get more head from your partner make it comfortable for them to give you head, don't make them gag by thrusting unless you've discussed it and they're cool with it. Imagine everytime you gave your partner a footrub they jammed two fingers down your throat unexpectedly, unless your into that you might stop giving foot rubs lol",

A bit unrelated but have empathy/ understanding if he gets sad or fustrated with libido difference (as long as its not directed towards you). My gf sometimes reject my initiations and sometimes it hurts and id be sad and fustrated - not at her, she has every right to decline if she wants (and the last thing on Earth I want is for her to do something she doesnt want to do), but sad because intimacy is a big part of how I show love and fustrated because its something I really look forward to.\n\nThe best thing my gf does is understand and comfort me/ validate my feelings because it is a rejection after all. Tell them how much you love them. Libido differences can be problematic in relationships and can often cause problems if communication and empathy isnt dialed in.",
